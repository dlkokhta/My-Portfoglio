        <p>
          Hello! I&apos;m Dimitri Kokhtashvili, a front-end-focused full-stack
          developer specializing in React and Next.js. I have a passion for
          building dynamic, responsive user interfaces and have experience
          creating efficient and scalable back-end systems with Express.js. My
          primary focus is on front-end development, ensuring a seamless user
          experience, but I also bring full-stack knowledge to projects that
          require it.
